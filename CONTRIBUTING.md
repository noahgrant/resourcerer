## Contributing to `with-resources`:

Please use the following guidelines when contributing to this repository:

* Use github issues to report bugs and feature requests. For help debugging, please use StackOverflow.

* Pull requests should be made to master. Before sending one for a feature or bug fix, be sure to add tests. Don't bother with documentation; we'll add it before we release.

* Use the same coding style as the rest of the codebase; besides passing tests, all changes must also pass style checks.
